# Vin Diesel Trucking

*CARFAX for Trailers* â€“ A personal project to gather and display trailer VINs, along with their repair, driver, and report history.

## Overview

**Vin-Diesel-Trucking** is a web-based tool that helps track and retrieve data tied to trailer VINs (Vehicle Identification Numbers).  
Think of it like a CARFAX report, but for trucking trailers.

This project is being developed to simplify maintenance, ownership, and operational transparency across trailer fleets by providing quick VIN lookups and report generation.

## Features (Planned & In Progress)

- **Search by VIN**: Input a specific VIN to retrieve associated trailer information, including service history, driver assignments, and usage reports.
- **Trailer List View**: Browse a list of trailers in the system and select one to view detailed info.
- **Trailer Detail Page**: See comprehensive data about a trailer, including:
  - Repair history  
  - Assigned drivers  
  - Incident and usage reports
- **Downloadable Reports**: Export trailer info as a CSV for offline use or recordkeeping.
